# Kanban BoardMD
**Problem:** Managing tasks within Obsidian markdown files became cumbersome as the number of tasks grew, making it difficult to track progress efficiently.

**Solution:** KanbanBoardMD is a SwiftUI, Mac OS app that reads tasks from Obsidian markdown files and displays them on a Kanban board. This visualization simplifies task management by providing a clear, organized view of task progress.
